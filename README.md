# Student Management System (Python Project)

A simple and clean Student Management System built using Python basics, OOP, File Handling, JSON, and List Comprehensions.

This project was created after completing Day 1–14 of Python learning (Apna College + self-practice). It stores student records permanently and offers a menu-driven interface.

Features:
- Add new student
- View all students
- Search student by name
- Update student marks
- Delete student records
- Display top scorers (90+)
- Stores data permanently using JSON
- Beginner-friendly CLI interface

Concepts Used:
- Variables, Data Types
- Loops, Conditionals
- Functions
- Lists, Dictionaries, Sets
- File Handling (r, w, a)
- JSON Module
- OOP (Classes, Constructors, Methods)
- List Comprehension
- Error Handling
